# Game of life
Conway's game of life in python and vue.js.

Conway`s Game of life is a 0 player game, which means given a initial state, it requires no more inputs.

With an initial patern of alive cells, the game develops based on the following rules:
> - A live cell dies if it has fewer than two live neighbors.
> - A live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
> - A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
> - A dead cell will be brought back to live if it has exactly three live neighbors.
